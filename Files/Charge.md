# Charge / Charge Bar

The charge bar is a UI element that appears on the screen while in aim mode. This bar goes up and down in size. Depending on where the bar size is when you throw it (Lowest : Full White, Highest : Full Red), it will apply a certain amount of power to the throw. Its the only somewhat well designed peice of UI in the game.
